mokeTrees Backend & Frontend Project

Project Overview

This project consists of a Backend built with Node.js, Express, and Sequelize (using SQLite as the database), along with a Frontend built with React. It allows users to register by submitting their name and address. The backend stores the user's name in a User table and their address in an Address table, with a one-to-many relationship (one user can have multiple addresses).

Features

Backend built with Node.js and Express. Relational database using Sequelize ORM (SQLite used for development). One-to-many relationship between users and addresses. Simple form in the Frontend (React) to capture user details. CORS enabled for cross-origin requests between the frontend and backend. JSON-based API for handling form submissions.
